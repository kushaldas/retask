Setting up the Redis Server
===========================
You can download and install `Redis <http://redis.io>`_ on your distro.
In `Fedora <http://fedoraproject.org>`_ you can just ``yum install redis``
for the same.

To start the server in the local folder use the following command:

::

    $ redis-server

On Fedora you can start the service as *root*:

::

    # service redis start
