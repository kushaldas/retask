Introduction
============

First requirement
-----------------

For various others projects I had to start looking for a
simple task queue and solve kind of classical producer-consumer problems
using them.

This project started from that idea.


Why Redis
---------

I am following `Redis <http://redis.io>`_  development for a long time and using
it in various other projects. The simplicity it provides and rich datastructures
are always a plus to use it. 

Redis takes care of multithreading issues, it also helps to have data on disk for
data persistence. It does not have any external dependencies and also very small
in size, which helps to be used in enterprise world.
